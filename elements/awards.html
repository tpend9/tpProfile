                    <p>The Braille Sensor device that helps the visually impaired turn Braille into sound.
                    Worn like a glove the devices main electrical components are in a small compartment
                    at the top of the hand, leading to the sensors at the tip of the fingers. These sensors
                    pick up the Braille and translate it into a specific language. Through this project,
                    Tremayne aims to assist the visually impaired speed up their learning process.</p>
